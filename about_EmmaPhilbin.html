        <!-- This paragraph is bout where I go to school and my family members -->
        <p>Hi, my name is Emma Philbin. I am fourteen years old and go to an all girls Catholic highschool. <b>The school in which I attend is Padua Academy in Delaware.</b> I have three siblings. One sibling is a younger brother in the sixth grade. Another sibling is an older sister, who is a junior at Padua.My third sibling is another older sister, who is a freshman at Villanova.</p>
        
        <!-- This paragraph is fun facts about myself -->
        <p>I am also an owner of three pets. I have two poodles and a lizard. A fun fact about myself is that I can play the flute. Another fun fact is that I can ride a horse. I love to make crafts and am part of the craft club at Padua. At Padua I am also part of a club called Operation Christmas Child. In this club I create boxes of toys to those whose families do not have enough money to pay for gifts. My favorite movie is <i>Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.</i> My favorite quote is,</p>
        <blockquote>Mistakes are proof that you are trying.</blockquote> 
        
        <!-- This paragraph is my school life -->
        <p>Before Padua, I went to a coed Catholic middleschool. The middleschool in which I attended is called St. Margaret's Regional School, which is located in New Jersey. I still talk to my friends from St. Margaret's and have made new friends here at Padua. I met some of my new friends in my electives that I take or have taken. In the first semester I took Art. In the second semester I am currently taking Web Page Design and am enjoying it. This was just a few facts about myself.</p>
